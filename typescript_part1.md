# Typescript

TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, itâ€™s a static type checker. TypeScript is a language that is a superset of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS. 
However, TypeScript is a typed superset, meaning that it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used
